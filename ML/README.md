### Overview

Social media such as tweets are emerging as platforms contributing to situational awareness during disasters. Effective use of such information requires timely selection and analysis of tweets that are relevant to a particular disaster. 

This repo contains the code created for Code Fun Do 2019, under the Challenge to create an app that could “Find better ways to save lives and prevent economic losses through mechanisms to predict, prevent, or manage the impact of natural disasters.” We develop an Android based Application to perform this task in mainly Kotlin and JAVA for Android environment Development, and Python for performing Machine Learning Tasks.

Our basic Idea is to create an App that could notify the user about a nearby disaster based on the users location at the soonest, Identify the type of Disaster using Tweets from various News Agencies. Also, based on the type we will be providing the basic precautions user could take, and also provide contact Information of the Official Authorities in the region related to the disaster.
Also we will aim to complete the following Key features of our App:

#### Key Features
* Predict the disaster related tweets, based on locations.
* Provide an alert system to user, with the details of local official authority and precaution tips. 
* One Tap feature to share the information about the disaster, with location, to emergency contacts.
* Provide Human Mobility Detail of local people to help in gathering, to get fast relief from Disaster relief Agencies.
